 abstract = {A great lack of 5G design is the traditional bottom-up development of network evolution, which has not effectively considered the requirements of applications and, particularly, vehicle to everything (V2X) applications. This paper provides a service-centric approach towards 6G V2X, with a concise overview of the upcoming hyper-connected vehicular ecosystem and its integration in the whole 6G fabric, analysing its particular infrastructure needs, as a way to reach key performance indicators (KPIs). We also present a 6G-oriented platform design able to manage the life-cycle of V2X applications across different domains by means of intelligent orchestration decisions.},
