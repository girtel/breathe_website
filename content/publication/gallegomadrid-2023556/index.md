abstract: A great lack of 5G design is the traditional bottom-up development of network
  evolution, which has not effectively considered the requirements of applications
  and, particularly, vehicle to everything (V2X) applications. This paper provides
  a service-centric approach towards 6G V2X, with a concise overview of the upcoming
  hyper-connected vehicular ecosystem and its integration in the whole 6G fabric,
  analysing its particular infrastructure needs, as a way to reach key performance
  indicators (KPIs). We also present a 6G-oriented platform design able to manage
  the life-cycle of V2X applications across different domains by means of intelligent
  orchestration decisions.
